# Password Generator

## Description
This password generator was created as if I were an employee with access to sensitive data. I wanted to randomly generate a password that is 8-128 characters, include uppercase and/or lowercase characters, numbers, and/or special characters so that I can create a strong password that provides greater security. I learned how to create global variables, call functions, while statements (with help from a fellow classmate), variables for user inputs and computer generated bank of answers. I also learned how to randomize the bank of answers for a custom password. I also came to an understanding of how Event Listeners work through this week of class and how to apply it in my project.
